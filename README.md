# SocialMediaFastAPIs

a.First We learn How to know the Path operation, Then analyze its decorator to mananage the different HTTP method

b.Then after we create a post method and check into the POSTMAN. After that we will enter the raw data in JSON format in POSTMAN then after we extract the data from the body from json and then after will return message of body content. And check whether there is proper extraction of the data in the response time.

c.We check the the api response of the Published variable which is True in default and rating which take the int type data types and have default none value.

d.Then after we send back the data in the response time by making in into the python dictory type.

e.The after we send data my making the user defined static data in my_posts variable.

f. Then after we send the new static id variable withing the specified randerang in the data json and if you see get in the response time you will see more new json data that we defined.

g. After we try to get the id of the post that we can easily alter the datas information. Here we can get the request for the single post by using the get_posts() method which we have defined in the main function CRUD operations.

h. Then after we create the method that will reponse the latest post that we have created in the postman. And after we set down the response error message which will be appear in the HTTP response time. After we works on the HTTP error handling process while creating post or not find the post.

i. Then I have saved the request HTTP method in directory named FastAPI course folder.Now, we will create the delete the post by making the new function using the delete http method.

j. After that we will completely update on the delete function by adding the Erro reponse time error message in POSTMAN by using the HTTP response method error message.

k. Now, we will successfully added the Update operation from the CRUD operation. So that we can updated our post according to the post id.

l. Now, we will works on the FastAPI document processs by using in the https links by adding / docs in the back point.

m. Then after we added the new app directory in the Fastapi main directory then after we will add the main.py python file in the app directory for the proper practice in the backend development.
